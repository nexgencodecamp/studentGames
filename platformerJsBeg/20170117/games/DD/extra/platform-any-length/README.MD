PLATFORM ANY LENGTH

Adds the ability to have platforms of any length (must be multiples of 40 pixels in length eg. 40, 80 120...etc)

Things to do:
Create a function in platform-any-length.js called createPlatform(), that can create a platform of any length (ie. make our code better!)
Create you own platforms and use them
