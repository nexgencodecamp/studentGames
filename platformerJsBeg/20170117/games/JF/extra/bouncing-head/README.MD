BOUNCING HEAD

Adds a 'bouncing-head' to the platform

Things to do:
Add an actual sprite rather than a 'red square'
Complete the collision detection with the player (We have started you off!)
Kill the player if hit (HINT: trigger an EVENT_PLAYER_DIE event)
Add the 'Jumpy' object to random platforms (HINT: modify this code - .addJumpy(true) in bouncing-head.js. Currently this adds a Jumpy for EVERY platform)
